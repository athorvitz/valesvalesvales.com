                    <p>"Vale in the usual religious language of our culture is a depressed emotional place – the vale of tears... the valley of the shadow of death... a "long depression or hollow... the world regarded as a place of troubles, sorrow, and weeping, and the world regarded as the scene of the mortal, the earthly, the lowly... the way of dreams, reflections, fantasies, reveries... where events are deepened into experiences." – James Hillman</p>
                    <p class="margin">In 2012 my best friend and longtime musical partner Dominic Ziegler died of an unexpected series of strokes at the age of 23. In early 2013 I returned home to the rural area of Northern California where we grew up, to grieve and recover from this almost inconceivable loss. Over the course of a few months, I wrote a series of songs filled with memories, sorrow, hope, and fear, streaked through with love for Dominic and with the pain of his passing, with light and dark, and rich with images of our home landscape – the hills and redwood forests, wild rivers filled with salmon, deer, hawks, and the torn up earth left by wild boars…</p>
                    <p class="margin">In the fall of 2013 I returned to Brooklyn and asked my friends Ben, Eliza, Bryan, and Trevor to start a new band to perform and record this material. In the depths of the coldest winter in memory, in temperatures reaching 30 below zero, we recorded the material in a 19th century Armory in Hoosick Falls, NY with the wonderful JJ Beck.</p>
                    <p class="margin">During my time in California, as part of our work on the Koans and Performance Project, my friends Jessica Sledge and Richard Hunter-Rivera made a series of films of Northern California, turning their unflinching eyes on the wild coast and mountains and industrial agriculture and suburbia. They’ve edited these films to fit the songs, though it’s more that the two arose together, from the same source.</p>
                    <p class="margin">VALES is a place where we can pause, stop, reflect, look and listen. I think it’s hard for us in our culture to accept anything that slows us down, stops us cold, makes us sad and humble and lowly and reminds us that we are creatures. But we all know that many, many things do this to us, over the course of a life. And maybe this isn’t so bad, because these things – although they’re often tragic – force us to forget our schemes and plans and really show up for life, they call us to the things of the world.</p>
                    <p class="margin">VALES, then, is an invitation to pause, and listen, and reflect, to feel our bodies and look around and remember that we are creatures with sorrows and pains and joys and this is in fact a wonderful thing… a world of images, pools of water, sheltered valleys on the internet…</p>
                    <p class="margin">If left alone, VALES will autoplay in the order of the album. Or you can find your own way, and you might even discover some surprises… I hope that you enjoy. Thank you for visiting.</p>
                    <p class="margin">Yours,</p>
